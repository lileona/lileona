## I've worked on...

### ðŸ§¾ Payroll API
- The Payroll API is a case study done during my internship. It features payroll generation using employee attendance data, importing of attenance records, exporting of payroll reports, and simple entity/resource management through CRUD operations. This API was built using TORO Cloud's Martini, RESTful APIs, and the HyperSQL DataBase (HSQLDB).

### ðŸ’­ [detoX](https://github.com/lileona/detoX)
- A Google Chrome browser extension for detecting and hiding 2022 Philippine Elections-related tweets with textual hate speech on Twitter using BERT.
- Our undergraduate thesis project for our CS Independent Study 1 and 2 courses at school.
- Makes use of a fine-tuned BERT model, particularly the RoBERTA Tagalog Base variant, which was trained using a dataset containing tweets from the 2016 and 2022 Philippine elections.

### ðŸ”­ [Thelescope Landing Page](https://github.com/lileona/thelescope-landing-page)
- Thelescope is a prototype of a patient record management system with an integrated audit log that utilizes blockchain technology. This landing page was created as part of our Cloud Computing course at school.
- My contribution to a final group project due one day before, where I created static webpages from scratch after a 6-hour crash course on HTML and CSS, despite no prior background knowledge. The design showcased in the 'Dizon' branch/directory in the navigation menu is my interpretation or implementation of Sarip's design.
